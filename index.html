<h1>Stoic Lessons</h1>
<p>A list of lessons from the philosopers Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius</p>

<div class="title"><h2>Epictetus</h2></div>
<ul class="epictetus">
  <li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
  <p>Our first job is this, to divide and distinguish things into two categories: <br>
  Externals I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to what I do control. Where will I find good and bad? In me, in my choices.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
  <p>It is not events that disturb people, it's thier judgement about things.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
  <p>Get rid of self conceit. It is impossible to learn that which one thinks they already know.</p>
</div>
</li>

  <li>
    <div class="lesson">
    <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
    <p>The true man is revealed in difficult times. So when trouble comes, think of yourself as a wrestler paired with a tough young buck. For what purpose? to turn you into olympic-class material. </p>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><h2>Seneca</h2></div>
<ul class="Seneca">
  <li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
  <p>There are more things likely to frighten us than there are to crush us; we suffer more in imagination than in reality</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 6</h3>
  <p>Excellence withers without an adversary</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 7</h3>
  <p>Associate with those who will make a better man of you. Welcome those whom you yourself can improve. The process is mutual; for men learn as they teach.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 8</h3>
  <p>This is our big mistake: to think we look forward to death. Most of death is already gone. Whatever time has passed is owned by death.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="title"><h2>Marcus Aurelius</h2>
<p>The four stoic virtues: <br>
Courage, moderation, justice, wisdom
</p>
</div>

<ul class="Marcus Aurelius">
<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 9</h3>
  <p>At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for; the things I was brought into this world to do. Or is this what I was created for? to huddle under the blankets and stay warm?</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 10</h3>
  <p>Our actions may be impeded, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accomodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 11</h3>
  <p>If, at some point in your life, if you should find anything better than justice, honestly, self-control, and courage, if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservation. It must be an extraordinary thing indeed.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 12</h3>
  <p>No. It's fortunate that this has happened (something perceived as bad) and I've remained unharmed by it-not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it.</p>
</div>
</li>

<li>
<div class="lesson">
  <h3>Lesson 13</h3>
  <p>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.</p>
